**DUSTBUNNiES** is a curated holding archive for **undatted, unclassified, and otherwise homeless ROMs, disk images, firmware, tools, and oddities** that do not currently belong in any known or official DAT set.

Think of it as a **quarantine / staging archive**:  
Files live here while they are unidentified, poorly classified, uncatalogued, or awaiting proper sorting into a real collection.

This is **not** a trash pile. Everything here is intentionally kept, categorized, and tracked.

---

## Purpose

- Hold files that:
  - Do not match any known DAT
  - Are not yet understood or identified
  - Belong to obscure, incomplete, or abandoned ecosystems
  - Are tools, dumps, formats, or fragments with no clear home
- Provide:
  - A structured place for “unknowns”
  - A way to track and gradually migrate items into proper sets
  - A historical record of “stuff that didn’t fit anywhere else (yet)”

If a file eventually gets properly identified and adopted into a real collection, **it should leave DUSTBUNNiES**.

---

## Collection Structure

DUSTBUNNiES is split into several high-level thematic groups, each with its own internal taxonomy.

- Amiga
- Amiga - Collections
- Commodore
- Core
- Core - Collections
- Disc
- Scene

## :pirate_flag: Scene

These are mostly scene folders containing metadata such as nfo, diz, and sfv. For use with the dats.site datfiles and scene folders that end up in these folders haven't been catalogued yet, or are not identical matches to what's expected in the dats.

---

## Curation Rules

- This is **not** an unsorted dumping ground.
- Everything here should:
  - Be categorized
  - Have a reason to exist here
  - Be a candidate for future identification or migration
- If something gets a proper home elsewhere, **it should be removed from DUSTBUNNiES**.

---

## Philosophy

- Real archives are built from uncertainty first.  
- DUSTBUNNiES is where uncertainty is allowed to exist — neatly.

## Contributing

Have some unknown files that still don't match with the dats? Pack your unknown files up into separate folders named for their system, then create a single archive for each system (zip/7z/rar/tar/gz are all acceptable).  Simply upload them to the Mega Uploads folder provided below. You don't need an account, simply drag and drop into the webpage! We'll give this a try and hopefully I won't see any abuse of the uploads folder.

If you would like to be recognized for your donations, include a note inside the uploads and I'll be sure to add you to a thank you list on this page.

Use the MEGA uploads folder here:
