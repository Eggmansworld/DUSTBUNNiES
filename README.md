**DUSTBUNNiES** is a curated holding archive for **undatted, unclassified, and otherwise homeless ROMs, disk images, firmware, tools, and oddities** that do not currently belong in any known or official DAT set.

Think of it as a **quarantine / staging archive**:  
Files live here while they are unidentified, poorly classified, uncatalogued, or awaiting proper sorting into a real collection.

This is **not** a trash pile. Everything here is intentionally kept, categorized, and tracked.

---

## Purpose

- Hold files that:
  - Do not match any known DAT
  - Are not yet understood or identified
  - Belong to obscure, incomplete, or abandoned ecosystems
  - Are tools, dumps, formats, or fragments with no clear home
- Provide:
  - A structured place for “unknowns”
  - A way to track and gradually migrate items into proper sets
  - A historical record of “stuff that didn’t fit anywhere else (yet)”

If a file eventually gets properly identified and adopted into a real collection, **it should leave DUSTBUNNiES**.

## Collection Structure

DUSTBUNNiES is split into several high-level thematic groups, each with its own internal taxonomy.

## Curation Rules

- This is **not** an unsorted dumping ground.
- Everything here should:
  - Be categorized
  - Have a reason to exist here
  - Be a candidate for future identification or migration
- If something gets a proper home elsewhere, **it should be removed from DUSTBUNNiES**.

---

## Philosophy

- Real archives are built from uncertainty first.  
- DUSTBUNNiES is where uncertainty is allowed to exist — neatly.
